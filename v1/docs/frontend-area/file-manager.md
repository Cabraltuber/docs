**CloudPanel** doesn't provide a **File Manager** because there are plenty of good tools for all operating systems.

With the following tools, you can upload and manage files via **FTP** or encrypted via **SFTP**.

Our recommendation is to use **Filezilla** as it's **free**, **easy to use**, and is under active development.

## macOS

- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) (**Free**)
- [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/)
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)

## Windows

- [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) (**Free**)
- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64) (**Free**)
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)

## Linux

- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=linux64) (**Free**)
