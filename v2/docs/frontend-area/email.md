**CloudPanel** doesn't provide **E-Mail** because of **performance**. We want to keep it **clean** and **lightweight**.

**E-Mail** is very **complex** and shouldn't be handled by the server that runs your **Applications**.

There are many companies that offer professional **E-Mail** services for less than **$ 1 / per user** per **month**.

## E-Mail Service Providers

- [Zoho Mail](https://www.zoho.com/mail/) (**FREE** but limited, **POP3** and **IMAP** only in paid version)
- [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) (Our **recommendation**)
- [Amazon WorkMail](https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/)
- [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/email/professional-business-email)
